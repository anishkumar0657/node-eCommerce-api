# node-eCommerce-api

Created a simple node js application which runs on port 3000.

The project uses MVC design which has models and controllers in node js file.
Have used REST APIs for interacting with frontend.
Here, I have used MongoDB for storing the data.


after downloading the project.

open it in VS code, and run npm install

to run the code you can type in npm start if you have nodemon installed

otherwise you can run using node app.js
